# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**VAScanner/VAScanner** is the open source repository for our article.

## DataBase
### **./**
It is the database we built which includes the vulnerable APIs mapping with vulnerable library versions and CVEs.

## RQ1
### **./result/augmentedCVE.txt**
It includes the CVEs involved in the augmentation mechanism and the patch pattern they belong to.  
### **./result/augmented_vul_root.json**
It includes the augmented vulnerable root methods by augmentation mechanism.  
### **./result/filteredCVE-sample.txt**
It includes 50 randomly selected CVE samples to analyze the effectiveness of the patch-unrelated filtering mechanism.  
### **./result/filter_sample_analysis.xlsx** 
It contains the results of our filtering mechanism analysis for the CVE samples, including false positive cases and false negative cases.   
### **./result/filtered_method.json**
It contains the methods which are ultimated filtered out for CVEs located in the database.

## RQ2
### **./dataset/LibDataSet.json**
It includes 200 CVEs we compared with Steady, as well as the corresponding libraries and versions.
